# Zalo for Franz
To get this recipe to work, copy it to the recipe folder:

- Mac: ~/Library/Application Support/Franz/recipes
- Windows: %appdata%/Franz/recipes
- Linux: ~/.config/Franz/recipes


AND the recipe folder above. it needs to be in both places. Seems to be buggy. Symlink works fine too.
